# Grid-Line-Detection
This project demonstrates how to detect grid lines in an image using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. The script processes an image to enhance and detect grid lines using adaptive thresholding, morphological transformations, edge detection, and Hough Line Transform. The output image shows the detected grid lines overlaid in blue.
